# TODO : 

## Examples

### Patchs : 
- Find why XSCHEM emit multiple XX1 elements --> Corrected, but need to find a better solution ! X1... X10... X100 ... Is there any way to make it automatic ?
- Correct python formatting of some spice strings to ensure ngspice WILL find the elements -> Top.so

### To add : 
- Add new examples, perhaps simplers ones ? 
- Add fully digital examples, perhaps without ngspice ? 
- Add fully analog exemples, perhaps RC filters or so on ? And, with fft to show different views ?
