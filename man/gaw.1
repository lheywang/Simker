gaw \- Gtk Analog Waveform viewer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gaw
[\fIfile.raw\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Gaw
is an analog waveform viewer based on the Gtk+ toolkit. It is designed to visualize and explore analog traces generated by SPICE simulators.
.PP
The tool reads simulation data from \fB.raw\fR files. It is historically based on the project hosted at \fIhttps://gaw.tuxfamily.org/\fR.
.SH SPICE INTEGRATION
To prepare your simulation data for viewing in \fBgaw\fR, you must instruct your SPICE simulator (such as Ngspice) to export the necessary vectors.
.PP
Use the following SPICE instructions within your netlist:
.IP
.nf
\fB.control\fR
  \fI" Export all vectors or specific nets to a file\fR
  \fBwrite spice.raw [all | v(net1) ... v(netX)]\fR
\fB.endc\fR
.fi
