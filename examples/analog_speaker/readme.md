# analog speaker example

This simple example run in pure analog mode.
It simulate the impedance curve of a speaker over a wide range of frequencies, from 10 Hz to 40 kHz.

This is to show more advanced ways of simulations which integrate some verilogA models.

## Running it ?

Just type 

```sh
xschem circuit.sch
```

or 
```sh
make sim
```

to open the XSCHEM GUI, and then, click on netlist and simulate.
An analog viewer shall be openned pretty quickly.
